This simple python program that I wrote in about 30 minutes takes a numerical argument from the command line and calculates all the prime numbers below it.

Here is an example how the program works with a very low argument (15):

    $ prime.py 15
    1 is prime. Hardcoded
    2 is prime. Hardcoded
    3 is prime. Hardcoded
    5 is prime. Hardcoded
    7 is prime. Calculated in 0.000006 seconds
                                                8 is divisible by 2
                                                9 is divisible by 3
                                                10 is divisible by 2
    11 is prime. Calculated in 0.000009 seconds
                                                12 is divisible by 2
    13 is prime. Calculated in 0.000005 seconds
                                                14 is divisible by 2
                                                15 is divisible by 5
    
    
    Done. Found 7 prime numbers below 15 in a total of 0.000058 seconds
